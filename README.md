# Fractals in Python

## Interface

Us the left mouse button to drag a selection box around the area you wish to
zoom in on.  Note: currently no box is displayed while selecting an area,
however the points are captured and zooming works.

Pan the image around using the right mouse button.  Right click and drag to
move the center of the image to a new location on the screen.

Reset the image to the original coordinate plane using the center mouse button.

The settings.py file contains some values that can be adjusted for various
results.  MAX_ITER is the fractal iteration.  COLOR_SCALE is a divisor for the
hue color palette (hoping to deprecate soon).


## Why though?

This is one of the first programs I've written for personal enrichment.  It's
a work in progress that I'm using to improve my python skills while obtaining
a better understanding of fractals and their algorithms.
